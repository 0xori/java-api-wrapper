## Build + Test

    # OSX
    $ brew install gradle
    $ gradle jar      # build jar file
    $ gradle test     # run tests

## Generate project files for various IDEs

If you want to work on the code in an IDE instead of a text editor you can
easily create project files with gradle:

    $ gradle idea     # Intellij IDEA
    $ gradle eclipse  # Eclipse

However, never commit any project files to the repo.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

  * Fork the project.
  * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
  * Add tests for it.
  * Commit, do not mess with buildfile, version, or history.
  * Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
